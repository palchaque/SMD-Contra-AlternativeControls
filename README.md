# SMD-Contra-AlternativeControls
Alternative shot 2 switching like on Contra3/4
Made primarily for personal use, I strongly recommend that esteemed connoisseurs of classic switching close the tab in their browser. 
The modified controls work similarly to parts 3 and 4 – to lock the character, you need to hold down one of the buttons – Y, Z, or MODE – rather than switching modes. 
It has been tested on Megadrive 1 Jap, Megadrive 2 Jap, Genesis 2 US, with the classic 6-button controller, the MadCatz 6-button controller (https://segaretro.org/Mad_Catz_6_Button_Controller), and the wireless controller from 8BitDo (https://shop.8bitdo.com/products/8bitdo-m30-bluetooth-gamepad-for-switch-pc-macos-and-android-with-sega-genesis-mega-drive). 
Currently, it has only been tested on the American version of the ROM 2bd30479556da5c310d8f2a1fe66e8fa. 
\Known issues – the mode switch is not displayed in the interface; this may be fixed in future updates. 
For development and debugging, used https://github.com/lab313ru/smd_ida_tools2.
